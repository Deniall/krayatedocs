        <h3>Welcome to the kRAYate Engine Documentation.</h3>

<p>In case you don't know what kRAYate is, visit this link: <a href="http://www.krayate.xyz">kRAYate Game Engine.</a></p>

        <h3> So you've just downloaded the BaseGame.zip, extracted, ran the .exe, and now want to make your own game. Great! </h3>

<p> Unfortunately, due to only being a short project, we did not get the time to create a fully fucntioning editor to work with the engine. However, you can still  use this engine to make your own game, using your own graphics, animations, sprites and scripts! Let's go through gameData.ini first of all. </p>
